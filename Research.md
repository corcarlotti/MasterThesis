Sir Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule, writes at the beginning of The Astonishing Hypothesis (1994): "The Astonishing Hypothesis is that 'You,' your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and your free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules."

-> wouldn't it be interesting to train machines in understanding how these nerve cells and molecules interact (with genes as their starting points)

basically create life artifically
create consciousness artifically
create emergence artifically??


Creation of Life 
Origin of Life


The question is, if my research is about the evolution of everything or about the creation of everything. 
Is god's work in the intelligent design-- instead in the creation of something out of nothing

is intelligent design the same as emergence? 


Is the universe conscious? 


Assembly Theory to predict emergence

Why do we want to predict everything? Control
 

 Why is this interesting to me? 
 Why do I think that prediction of new species based on their dna is interesting to me? 

 Because it is complex. It's too complex for humans to understand. And too complex for machines to understand? Well that could be due to the programming human's limited understanding.

 I want to use AI / machines basically to do complex things that are too complex for humans. Are machines the best way to ... ann√§hern .. this problem? 

 Can we fast forward the complex networks of natures to use it for speculation? 

 So I am interested in simulation in order to speculate. In order to learn. To use it as a tool to learn, I guess.

 Ok let's start with writing your own model please.
