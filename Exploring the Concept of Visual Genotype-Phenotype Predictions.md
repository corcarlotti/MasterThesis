<h2>Exploring the Concept of Visual ‚Genotype -> Phenotype‘ Predictions through ML	</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

...

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This chapter provides an introduction to the concept of predicting genotype-phenotype relations based on the body development of organisms using machine learning. First, I will explain certain building blocks of the concept in detail to provide a prerequisite for understanding the concept. In addition, I will present applications and research that strive to implement this concept and their objectives. I will then examine what additional potential the algorithmic implementation of this concept would offer.


<h4>Genotype - Phenotype relation</h4> 

The genotype represents the total amount of genetic information of an organism. [Different variants of the same gene.] In contrast, the phenotype is the set of observable characteristics of an organism.
