For my graduation project, I plan to design a machine learning model that visualizes predictions from genotype to phenotype translations. This model will be trained using pairs of genotype representatives, that is, genetic material, a dataset of organism-specific hox genes and possibly other genes relevant to morphogenesis, and a phenotype representative, the visualization of the physical characteristics of the respective organism, an image or 3D model. The aim of this project is not the scientifically correct execution, but the investigation of the relevance of the concept in the context of its artistic and scientific potential. 

I intend to use the thesis for this investigation to deepen my own knowledge and and to find clarity in the turmoil of the interweaving of this concept with artistic, philosophical, scientific and social ideas. I aim to gain a holistic perspective of the interplay between art, science (genetics and technology) and society, and to be able to bring this into an open dialogue.


I plan to structure the thesis in the following inquiries:

* Introduction/State of the art: In this section, I will introduce the genotype-phenotype relationship and then I am going review algorithms or models that make ‚genotype -> phenotype` predictions that are already in use, e.g. in criminology, or being researched on. I aim to investigate with which objective these algorithms are applied and what other potential application areas arise from the implementation. Relevant Resources: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]

* Method and Comparison: In the elaboration of this chapter, I plan to describe how the algorithm I am developing works and contrast it with potential and in use implementations of other relevant algorithms. One comparison that possibly can be of interest is the mapping of computed values to the visualization. In this context, I also find it interesting to address the impact of the implementations on the results. Relevant Resources: 

* Discussion: In the discussion, I would like to reflect on limitations from the implementation of the algorithm, including those due to data ownership and privacy. In addition, I want to examine the influence of subjectivity on the interpretation of the analysis of genetic data and the importance of cultural and societal influence for the interpretation of Machine Learning created results in the field of "Artificial Life“. Relevant Resources: 

Doubts 

0 - very extensive, 
1 - I am unsure if I can manage to create clarity in the confusion of all these ideas. 
2 - I am unsure how far I will get in developing this model 3 - order/structure 
4 - objective still a bit vague
