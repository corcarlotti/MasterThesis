<h2>Exploring the Concept of Visual >Bodyform< ‚Genotype -> Phenotype‘ Predictions through ML	</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

...

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This chapter provides an introduction to the concept of predicting genotype-phenotype relations based on the body development of organisms using machine learning. First, I will explain certain building blocks of the concept in detail to provide a prerequisite for understanding the concept. In addition, I will present applications and research that strive to implement this concept and their objectives. I will then examine what additional potential the algorithmic implementation of this concept would offer.


<h4>Genotype - Phenotype relation</h4> 

The genotype represents the total amount of genetic information of an organism. [Different variants of the same gene.] In contrast, the phenotype is the set of observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism. The phenotype arises from the interaction of many different genes, and additionally their interaction with many different environmental variables, such as abiotic factors, culture, or symbionts.
